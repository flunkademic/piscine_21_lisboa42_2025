Absolutely! Here's a **basic-level quiz** on **pointers**, tailored to your level at 42 school (`C Piscine` style). It's a mix of concepts, syntax, and some code comprehension questions. Iâ€™ll quiz you first, then give answers after unless you ask for hints.

## ðŸ§  42 Pointers Quiz â€” Level: Beginner

### ðŸ“˜ Concept Questions

1. **What does `int *ptr;` mean in C?**
 declaring a pointer of data-type integer called *ptr

2. **What does the `&` operator do when used in front of a variable?**
Referencing an address of the variable to be able to point towards it and its value. 
3. **What does the `*` operator do when used in front of a pointer?**
Have no idea? Point?
4. **What is the difference between `*ptr` and `&ptr`?**
*ptr is the pointer name, and &ptr is the thing pointed at, like the address of ptr is what we store in *ptr.
5. **How would you declare a pointer `p` that stores the address of an `int` variable `x`?**

int *p = &x;

### ðŸ’» Code Comprehension

6. What will this print?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void test(int *p)
{
    *p = 100;
}

int main()
{
    int a = 5;
    test(&a);
    printf("%d\n", a);
    return 0;
}

It will print 5. Right? Cause the value of 5 will be passed at the address of int *p?  Please explain this to me better.

7. What will this print?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    int *ptr = &a;
    *ptr = *ptr + 5;
    printf("%d\n", a);
    return 0;
}
```
print out 15?

8. Will this code compile? Why or why not?

```c
int *ptr;
*ptr = 42;
```

No? Cause we need to store 42 somewhere? I mean, now it will give the address that stores into *ptr the value int of 42, but since this pointer points nowhere? I guess it won't work? Please explain more.

9. Which of these correctly assigns the address of variable `a` to pointer `p`?

a) `int a; int *p; p = a;`
b) `int a; int *p; p = &a;`
c) `int a; int *p; *p = a;`
d) `int a; int *p; &p = a;`


I think a is the correct answer, but all these options confuse me, please give me some answers and explanations for all your variations here.

10. Fill in the blanks to complete the function that sets the value at the pointer to 42:

```c
void ft_ft(int *nbr)
{
    ______ = 42;
}
```

*nbr = 42;
