 Now Let's Practice: Small Pointers-to-Char Exercises
游댲 Exercise 1: Print first character of a string using a pointer
Fill in the blanks:



#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char *str = "Piscine is wild!";
    printf("%c\n", str[0]*);
    return 0;
}
游대 Goal: Use pointer notation to print 'P'.

游댲 Exercise 2: Change a single character via pointer


#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char c = 'X';
    char *ptr = &c;

    *ptr = 'Z';
    printf("%c\n", c); // Should print Z
    return 0;
}
游대 Goal: Point to c and change its value to 'Z'.

游댲 Exercise 3: Access and print each character in a string
Write a loop to print all characters of the string "42":



#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char *str = "42";
    int i = 0;

    while (str[i] != '\0') {
        printf("%c\n", str[i]);
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
游댲 Exercise 4: Change the value of a char * inside a function


#include <stdio.h>
void update_str(char **ptr) {
    *ptr = "New value!";
}

int main() {
    char *str = "Old value";
    *ptr = &str;?
    update_str(&str);
    printf("%s\n", str); // Should print: New value!
    return 0;
}
游대 Question: Why do we pass &str to the function?
Oh damn, I didn't even see the question until later. We pass &str because we need str's address and the value it stores at that address to chnage into what the pointer value is pointing at. So it's dereferencing via pointer?

游댲 BONUS: Function to return the length of a string using pointer arithmetic


int ft_strlen(char *str){
    int len = 0;
    while (len <= str[i] && str[i] != '\0') {
        len++;
        str++;
    }
    return len;
}
游대 Fill in the condition so the loop stops at the null terminator ('\0')
