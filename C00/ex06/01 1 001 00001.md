When you write:
c
Copy
Edit
int x = 1;
That means:

The computer stores the number 1, not "01".

There’s no such thing as a leading zero in an int. So 01, 1, and 0001 are all just the number 1 to the computer.

The number 1 does not remember whether you wrote it as 1 or 01 in your code.

🟡 But what about printing 01?
If you want the output to look like two digits (e.g., 01 instead of 1), you have to format it manually.

For example:

✅ Option 1: Math + ASCII (common in Piscine)
c
Copy
Edit
int x = 1;
write(1, &(char){(x / 10) + '0'}, 1); // tens digit
write(1, &(char){(x % 10) + '0'}, 1); // units digit
This prints:

Copy
Edit
01
✅ Option 2: Using printf (not allowed in most Piscine projects)
c
Copy
Edit
printf("%02d", x);
%02d means: “print an integer with at least 2 digits, pad with zeros if needed.”

This also prints:

Copy
Edit
01
🔁 Summary
Code	Value in memory	What it prints	What you see
int x = 1;	1	1	1
int x = 01;	also 1	1	1
Use division/modulo	1	0, 1	01
Use printf("%02d", x);	1	01	01

🔒 Bonus Tip
If you write:

c
Copy
Edit
int x = 01;
In some older C compilers, 01 (starting with a 0) can be interpreted as octal (base 8). That’s usually a bad idea unless you’re doing it on purpose.

So always just write:

c
Copy
Edit
int x = 1;  // not 01
Let me know if you want to practice converting integers to digit characters or building something that prints 00 to 99 cleanly.
