Ah! Perfect, now we’re talking about **GCC compiler flags**. Let’s break down each one carefully:

You wrote:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c
```

Here’s what each flag does:

---

### 1. `-Wall`

* Stands for **“Warn all”** (or more accurately, “warn about most common issues”).
* Enables a set of **common warning messages** that the compiler thinks are useful for catching potential bugs.
* Examples of warnings it enables: unused variables, functions declared but not used, or suspicious assignments.

💡 Important: `-Wall` **doesn’t literally turn on all warnings**, but it’s the baseline for good warning coverage.

---

### 2. `-Wextra`

* Stands for **“Warn extra”**.
* Enables **additional warnings** not included in `-Wall`.
* Examples: comparisons between signed and unsigned types, missing function prototypes in some cases, or extra semicolons.

💡 Use `-Wextra` when you want **stricter checking** and catch more subtle mistakes.

---

### 3. `-Werror`

* Stands for **“Warnings as errors”**.
* Treats **all compiler warnings as errors**, so your code **will not compile if any warning exists**.
* Purpose: forces you to write **clean, warning-free code** — very common in professional or school projects.

---

### Summary

* `-Wall` → catch most common warnings.
* `-Wextra` → catch even more warnings.
* `-Werror` → warnings are treated as errors; compilation fails if any exist.

✅ Together, these flags ensure your code is **robust, clean, and warning-free**, which is why your `ft_print_alphabet.c` example compiles cleanly with them.

If you want, I can also explain **a few common warnings you might see with these flags** and how to fix them — it’s really useful for 42 school exercises. Do you want me to do that?
